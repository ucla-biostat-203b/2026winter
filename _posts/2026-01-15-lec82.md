## Today

* Docker and Lab 3.

* Lab 1 (cont'd): submit hw assignments via GitHub Classroom.

* Data ingestion and tidying.

## Announcement

* Survey: have homework assignment due on Sundays, instead of Fridays?

## Q&A

* PhysioNet credentialing process may take long. After successful credentialing, you can DM TA or me on Slack so we can add you to a UCLA Box folder where you can download the MIMIC data set. In my experience, downloading from the PhysioNet website is very slow, taking 4-5 hours.

* Windows WSL user, make sure to follow the [instructions](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-server/) for your specific Ubuntu version.

* Zoo of IDEs: RStudio, VS Code, Positron, Vibe Coding (Cursor, ...) 

* Positron demo. No analog of `.Rproj` for Positron. Working directory is the opened folder. Clone Repository, copilot code completion, Git pull/commit/push, terminal, R console, Quarto Markdown rendering, Positron Assistant, data explorer, SSH remote, etc.
