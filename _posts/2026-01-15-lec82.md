## Today

* Docker and Lab 3.

* Data ingestion and tidying.

## Announcement

* Survey: have homework assignment due on Sundays, instead of Fridays?

* Positron demo. No analog of `.Rproj` for Positron. Working directory is the opened folder.

## Q&A

* PhysioNet credentialing process may take long. After successful credentialing, you can DM TA or me on Slack so we can add you to a UCLA Box folder where you can download the MIMIC data set. In my experience, downloading from the PhysioNet website is very slow, taking 4-5 hours.

* Windows WSL user, make sure to follow the [instructions](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-server/) for your specific Ubuntu version.
